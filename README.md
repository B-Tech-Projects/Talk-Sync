# TalkSync

## Overview

**TalkSync** is a real-time meeting platform that leverages live speech-to-speech language translation. The platform enables participants speaking different languages to communicate effectively during live meetings, breaking language barriers in real-time. This is achieved using technologies like **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **Socket.io**, and **WebRTC** to provide smooth translation and streaming functionalities.

## Technology Stack

- **Node.js:** Backend runtime to handle requests, authentication, and other server-side logic.
- **Express.js:** Framework for handling HTTP requests and routing.
- **Socket.io:** Enables real-time, bidirectional communication between users.
- **WebRTC:** Facilitates audio and video streaming between meeting participants.
- **Speech-to-Text API:** Converts live speech into text for processing.
